			&emsp;&emsp; Educational trip  to a research laboratory is considered as a fundamentally different educational experience from the ones students usually encounter within their formal schooling. There are year-round visits of students and faculty from various institutions who get a first-hand experience of an elite Scientific Institution. NISER faculty members and the Scientific Officers of various Schools continue to participate in educational activities for students and teachers in the country who are not directly connected with NISER.

		<br>
		<p style="text-align: justify">
			&emsp;&emsp; When school students observe the work-life of people at NISER and interact with them, it leads to better achievement, standards, motivation, personal development and behavior in them. These visits also help to enhance the social, personal and emotional development of all participants. They are left with a sense of imagination and new found interest for science. In the past year there have been around 10 educational trips of schools from parts of the country.

			&emsp;&emsp; The results obtained show that the school visits have very positive effects on the studentsâ€™ level of information about the institutional functioning of the research center while at the affective level they contribute to a deflation of the mythological status of scientific research to its real dimensions.
