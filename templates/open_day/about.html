			&emsp;&emsp; The Open Day at NISER is conducted every year as an outreach activity to introduce young
			students to different fields of basic sciences and scientific research. Not only does it help
			school students make informed career choices but also acts as an excellent opportunity for
			inducing creative thinking among NISER students who apply this knowledge in various
			coursework to come up with interesting and motivating experiments every year.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify">
			&emsp;&emsp; The program is aimed for school students (class 8th-12th) and involved lectures by NISER
			faculty members, laboratory visits and demonstrations conducted by students of the institute. NISER Students
			from different departments exhibited several experiments demonstrating scientific concepts taught in school
			as well as some relatively advanced ideas.
